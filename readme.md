## Description
In this mini-project, we will be working with a data set of baby names in France. It contains the list of all baby names registered in France, year by year, from 1900 through 2020. There are two data sets: one aggregated to the national level, and another with data by department. Your goal is to create 3 different visualizations around these data, each focussed on answering different kinds of questions about the data:
*   **Visualization 1:** How do baby names evolve over time? Are there names that have consistently remained popular or unpopular? Are there some that have were suddenly or briefly popular or unpopular? Are there trends in time?
*   **Visualization 2:** Is there a regional effect in the data? Are some names more popular in some regions? Are popular names generally popular across the whole country?
*   **Visualization 3:** Are there gender effects in the data? Does popularity of names given to both sexes evolve consistently? (Note: this data set treats sex as binary; this is a simplification that carries into this assignment but does not generally hold.)
## Installation Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedbellaaj10/Baby_names_project.git
   ```	
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```	
3. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Each of the notebooks contains some visualization work related to one type of visualization, for some visualizations, we decided to show some insights and gi further to create alternative designs, for some others, we decided to work on two variants of visualization and try to compare them.

We home you find our work insight!
